// ServiceError is the one error type whose message passes through to the client verbatim
// (ServiceRouter returns it as the 400 body; everything else becomes 'Internal server error').
// ServiceExecutor wraps every error a service method throws in a ServiceError that preserves the
// original message, so service messages always reach the client. Exported for layers that throw
// outside a service method body (e.g. @proteinjs/db TableServiceAuth) and want the same pass-through.
